**Predicting Music Trends**

The music market is extremely competitive with artists always trying to make the next viral song and get the most streams. For this roject, Our group aims to find a way to see if we can develop an algorithm that can give artists a competitive edge. 

 Based on the date it was released, bpm, key, energy, danceability, acoustic-ness and more, we are looking to see if we can predict the following:
 
•How many streams?

•Is it in spotify’s playslists?

•Is it in spotify’s charts?

We plan on utilizing some dataset we found on Kaggle that has all those metrics already. We plan to pick a song, remove it from the dataset and then use that dataset to train a model to predict the streams and other info. This way we have ground truth to compare our results to.


The dataset can be found in the following link:
